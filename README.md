# KIVAPROJECT

[Kiva.org](https://www.kiva.org/) is an online crowdfunding platform to extend financial services to poor and financially excluded people around the world. Kiva lenders have provided over $1 billion dollars in loans to over 2 million people. In order to set investment priorities, help inform lenders, and understand their target communities, knowing the level of poverty of each borrower is critical. However, this requires inference based on a limited set of information for each borrower.

For the locations in which Kiva has active loans, our objective is to pair Kiva's data with additional data sources to estimate the welfare level of borrowers in specific regions, based on shared economic and demographic characteristics.  We are going to work on the [Kiva dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-tJtnIbo1Rt-F1XfoWGVkmBXiI-ciuRx/view). Some information on the datasets are available on the [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/gaborfodor/undefined) web page.
